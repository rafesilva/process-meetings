# API Sample Test

## How to Improve This Project

Add clear comments and simple explanations throughout the code to make it easier for new developers to understand.

Break large blocks of code into smaller, reusable functions like fetching meetings and handling associations. This keeps the code cleaner and more manageable.

Use more human readable variable names; for instance, rename q to something like actionQueue to better convey its purpose.

Separate HubSpot API logic into its own module or service file. This would make the main function focused and easier to test.

Create utility functions for repeated patterns, like retry logic or error handling, to avoid duplication and make updates easier.

Fetch contact details and associations in batches instead of one by one to reduce API calls and speed up processing.

Use caching for frequent lookups, like contact details, to avoid unnecessary calls to HubSpot.

Implement a rate-limiting mechanism to respect HubSpotâ€™s API limits and prevent errors from too many requests at once
